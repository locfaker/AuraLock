"""
Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) Attack.

FGSM is a simple but effective single-step adversarial attack.
It computes the gradient of the loss with respect to the input image,
then adds a small perturbation in the direction that maximizes the loss.

Paper: "Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples"
       https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572

Formula:
    adversarial = image + epsilon * sign(gradient)
    
Where:
    - epsilon: perturbation magnitude (e.g., 0.03 or 8/255)
    - gradient: ∂Loss/∂image
